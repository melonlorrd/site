# Not Everything Needs Science

I assure you, I am not a science denier. But sometimes I wonder, does everything in life really need a scientific reason?

There is no doubt that science is the best system we humans have for understanding and proving what is true about the world. Over centuries, we have refined this system, questioning, experimenting, and improving it, and it continues to evolve as we learn more. Science has given us technology, medicine, and a deeper understanding of nature’s laws. It is one of the greatest achievements of the human mind.

But the other day, while sitting in a taxi, listening to hymns dedicated to Lord Shiva playing softly on the radio, a question wandered into my mind. People all over the world worship deities, follow rituals, and hold traditions close to their hearts. Before science became the dominant way of understanding reality, religion and culture were seen as absolute truth. But today, we live in an age where everyone seems to either disprove religion through science or try to prove religion with science, often without really following scientific principles at all.

There’s this growing urge to validate everything with a scientific reason. You will often hear people say that lighting a lamp drives away bacteria, or that ancient sages knew the secrets of quantum physics through meditation. Many modern spiritual organizations, like ShivYog or Isha Foundation, often attempt to show that old rituals and traditions were deeply scientific, as if that is the only way to make them worthy of respect.

But here is what I think, not everything we do needs a scientific justification.

I do certain things simply because they mean something to me. I say Ram Ram to people I meet in the morning, not because I think it aligns the planets or guarantees a spot in heaven, but because it reminds me of people I care about. It evokes warmth and familiarity. It connects me to something intangible yet deeply human. Science does not need to explain that.

Humans are social creatures. We crave connection, with each other, with our ancestors, and sometimes with something larger than ourselves. Even a monk who has renounced worldly life still seeks connection, only now it is with the divine, or with the inner self. That connection, too, is valid. Their belief might not be real to us, but it is real to that person. And that reality deserves to exist without requiring a scientific stamp of approval.

This does not mean I am dismissing science. Science is essential where facts, evidence, and consequences matter, in healthcare, technology, and our understanding of the environment. If you jump off a building, gravity will pull you down, no matter how deeply you believe that you will fly. Theories of gravity, vaccines, or climate change are not beliefs, in fact they are descriptions of reality supported by evidence.

But when it comes to rituals, traditions, and emotions, not everything needs to be measured, proven, or dissected.Lighting a lam p during Diwali does not need to "kill bacteria" to be meaningful. It fills the home with warmth and light, symbolizes victory over darkness, and brings families together. That’s reason enough.

Unfortunately, in today’s world, belief itself has become a kind of business. Many modern gurus and influencers try to dress spirituality in the language of pseudoscience to make it sound more appealing or credible. They will tell you that ancient Indians knew quantum mechanics or that cosmic vibrations can heal your DNA. But this kind of pseudoscience does not validate either science of spirituality or spirituality of science, instead it diminishes both. It disrespects our genuine cultural heritage and our real scientific achievements by mixing them into a confused and marketable myth.

And yet, it is possible, and beautiful, to hold multiple truths in your head at once. You can believe in science and still have faith. You can respect data and still find comfort in a prayer. The God or the universe or whatever higher power you believe in likely blessed us with a complex brain for a reason, to think, to feel, and to find meaning in many different ways.
